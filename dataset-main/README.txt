This folder contains all the test instances used in primary numerical experiments introduced in the main text of our manuscript.
Here each instance is named as "pset_mXX_nXX_oX_g1_X.txt", where
(1) The number after 'm' is the number of nests in the CNL model;
(2) The number after 'n' is the number of potential products;
(3) The number after 'o' is the level index of the overlapping rate, all instances in the primary numerical expreiments are based on level 0 (overlapping rate = 1.2)
(4) The number at the end is the serial number of the instance within the same combination of (n,m,o)
