This folder contains all test instances used in the primary numerical experiments presented in the main text of our manuscript.
Each instance is labeled using the format "pset_mXX_nXX_oX_g1_X.txt", where
1. The number following 'm' denotes the number of nests in the CNL model;
2. The number following 'n' indicates the number of potential products;
3. The number following 'o' represents the index of the overlapping rate level. All instances used in the primary numerical expreiments correspond to level 0 (overlapping rate = 1.2);
4. The final number specifies the serial identifier for instances generated under the same combination of (n,m,o).
