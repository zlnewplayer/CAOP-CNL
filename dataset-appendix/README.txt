This folder contains all test instances used in the numerical experiments presented in Appendix C, where we investigate the impact of overlapping rates on the performance of our exact method. 
The labeling of these instances follows the same convention as those used in the primary numerical experiments, with the only difference being the number following 'o', which indicates the level of overlapping rate. Specifically, the six overlapping rate levels considered here are:
o0 - overlapping rate = 1.2
o1 - overlapping rate = 2.0
o2 - overlapping rate = 3.0
o3 - overlapping rate = 1.0
o4 - overlapping rate = 1.5
o5 - overlapping rate = 2.5
